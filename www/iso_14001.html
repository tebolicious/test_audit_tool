            There are approximately 210 questions in this part that cover the complete requirements of the standard from a system design perspective. Part 1 uses the Turtle Diagram Audit approach to examine the complete system. Part one consists primarily of evidence based questions which confirm the conformity of the system, There are some BP (best practice) questions which will help to better evaluate the level of effectiveness of the system and there are AP (audit process) questions designed to help the auditor the gather data which can be used later in the audit to make the audit more effective. </p>

            <b>Introduction</b><br/>
            Every organization is a unique entity with its own history, culture and belief systems. To the extent that this culture does not negatively affect the organization’s ability to satisfy its customers and achieve its objectives, the Environmental Management System (QMS) should reflect that culture.</p>

            <b>Top Management</b><br/>
            It is very important that the most senior management of the organization is active and takes a leadership role in the development and ongoing success of the QMS. Depending on the organization and its structure top management may be a single individual or a small group. But it is important that senior management is that person or group that has the power to delegate authority and provide resources for the development and leadership of the QMS (See General clause 1.1 of ISO 14001:2015).</p>

             <b>Questions for top management</b><br/>
            AP – During your interview with Top Management and members of Sr. Management if a document or record is mentioned – stop the auditee – ask for the document – review it for legibility, availability, proper use and completeness. Look for evidence of poor performance or customer issues. Once satisfied make notes of your evidence and return the document to its owner.</p>
