        <p>NOTE: If the organization is upgrading from ISO 14001:2008 it is equally important that senior management get actively involved. Many systems in the past have been developed by consultants, individual managers, or staff employees. These systems usually met the requirements of the standard, but often the system developed did not recognize the unique culture of the organization or the strategic objectives of senior management. As a result, the EMS conformed but was not efficient, nor effective. Therefore if the system is to be efficient, effective and add value to the organization, it must be developed with the direct involvement and participation of top management.</p>
